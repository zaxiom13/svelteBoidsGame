# Wall Collision and Border Sticking Tests Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite added to ensure boids don't go through walls, don't stick to borders, and are appropriately sized.

## Tests Added

### 1. Wall Collision Tests (20 tests)

#### Wall Penetration Detection (3 tests)
- ✅ **should not allow boid to move into wall** - Verifies wall avoidance force is generated when approaching walls
- ✅ **should detect when boid is inside wall** - Verifies detection logic for boids inside wall boundaries
- ✅ **should generate strong escape force when inside wall** - Ensures strong repulsion force when boid is inside a wall

#### Wall Sticking Prevention (2 tests)
- ✅ **should not get stuck parallel to wall** - Tests tangential movement along walls doesn't cause sticking
- ✅ **should escape from corner** - Verifies boids can escape from corner situations

#### Door Collision (2 tests)
- ✅ **should avoid closed doors** - Ensures closed doors are treated as obstacles
- ✅ **should pass through open doors** - Verifies open doors don't generate avoidance forces

#### High-Speed Collision (4 tests)
- ✅ **should stop fast-moving boid from penetrating wall** - Tests wall avoidance with high-speed boids
- ✅ **should handle multiple update cycles near wall** - Simulates 10 frames of movement near walls
- ✅ **should prevent wall penetration with full physics simulation** - Comprehensive 50-frame simulation with full physics
- ✅ **should not penetrate wall from any angle** - Tests approach from all 4 directions (left, right, top, bottom)

#### Border Sticking Prevention (7 tests)
- ✅ **should not stick to arena border** - Verifies border avoidance forces are generated
- ✅ **should escape from border after multiple frames** - Ensures boids move away from borders over time
- ✅ **should not get stuck at left border with full physics** - 100-frame simulation at left border
- ✅ **should not get stuck at right border** - 100-frame simulation at right border
- ✅ **should not get stuck at top border** - 100-frame simulation at top border
- ✅ **should not get stuck at bottom border** - 100-frame simulation at bottom border
- ✅ **should not stick to corners** - Tests all 4 corners with 100-frame simulations

#### Wall Force Validation (2 tests)
- ✅ **should never produce NaN force** - Validates force calculations don't produce invalid values
- ✅ **should produce reasonable force magnitudes** - Ensures forces are within acceptable ranges

### 2. Wall Configuration Tests (4 tests)
- ✅ **should have walls defined** - Verifies WALLS array exists and has content
- ✅ **should have valid wall dimensions** - Checks all walls have positive dimensions within arena
- ✅ **should have doors defined** - Verifies DOORS array exists and has content
- ✅ **should have valid door dimensions** - Validates door properties and orientations

### 3. Boid Size Tests (3 tests)
- ✅ **should have small boid size in visual settings** - Verifies boidSize ≤ 5 pixels
- ✅ **should render boids with small visual size** - Tests effective size with zoom factor
- ✅ **boids should be significantly smaller than walls** - Ensures boids are < 1/4 of wall thickness

## Key Findings

### Boid Size Configuration
- Boid size is set to **4 pixels** in `visualSettings`
- With default zoom of 0.25, effective render size is **16 pixels**
- Boids are significantly smaller than wall thickness (40 pixels)

### Wall Avoidance System
The system uses multiple detection zones:
- **Detection radius**: 100 pixels - early warning system
- **Urgent radius**: 40 pixels - emergency avoidance kicks in
- **Inside detection**: Special escape logic for boids trapped in walls

### Border Avoidance System
- **Margin**: 60 pixels - soft repulsion zone
- **Urgent margin**: 20 pixels - strong repulsion when very close
- Uses 3x force multiplier for strong pushback

## Test Results
```
✓ 27 tests passed in wallCollision.test.js
✓ 163 total tests passed in entire test suite
✓ No regressions introduced
```

## Implementation Details

### Wall Avoidance Algorithm (`avoidWalls()`)
1. Checks distance to all static walls and closed doors
2. Uses different force strengths based on proximity:
   - Inside obstacle: Force 10.0 (very strong)
   - Touching (< 1px): Force 8.0 (strong)
   - Urgent (< 40px): Force 6.0 (emergency)
   - Normal (< 100px): Force 3.0 (standard)
3. Adds tangential forces to help slide along walls
4. Averages forces when near multiple obstacles

### Border Avoidance Algorithm (`avoidBorders()`)
1. Checks distance from all 4 arena edges
2. Applies graduated force:
   - Within 60px: Standard force
   - Within 20px: 3x force multiplier
3. Normalizes and scales force by `maxForce * 3`

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/src/lib/__tests__/wallCollision.test.js` - Added comprehensive test suite

## Current Boid Size Settings
```javascript
visualSettings: {
  boidSize: 4,  // Small size (was 10)
  trailLength: 8,
  trailWidth: 1,
  trailOpacity: 0.15,
  neighborRadius: 30,
  separationRadius: 20
}
```

## Recommendations
1. ✅ Current boid size (4 pixels) is appropriate
2. ✅ Wall avoidance system is working correctly
3. ✅ Border sticking prevention is effective
4. ✅ High-speed collisions are properly handled
5. ✅ All 4 border edges prevent sticking
6. ✅ Corners are handled correctly

## Conclusion
All tests pass successfully. The boid system correctly:
- Prevents wall penetration from any angle
- Avoids getting stuck on borders or walls
- Uses appropriately small boid sizes for the arena scale
- Handles high-speed movements near obstacles
- Properly escapes from corners and tight spaces
